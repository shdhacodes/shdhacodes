# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm on an exciting journey to become a coder, and every day is a new learning experience. Though I'm just starting out, I'm determined to keep improving and growing my skills. 

When I'm not diving into code, you can find me enjoying sports or exploring the latest in tech. I'm passionate about both, and I believe that the dedication and teamwork I learn in sports will help me become a better coder too.

Follow along with my journey as I learn, build, and create! ðŸš€
